The **Theatre** tab is where you preview and share your final video. It displays the merged video that combines all your scene motion clips with the generated music track.

## Video Player

When a merged video is available, it displays in a full video player sized to your sequence's aspect ratio. The player is centered in the viewport and constrained to fit the screen height.

### Share Menu

A share button (top-right corner of the player) opens a dropdown with:

- **Copy video URL** — Copies the direct video URL to your clipboard
- **Download video** — Downloads the `.mp4` file with a filename based on your sequence title (e.g., `My_Sequence_openstory.mp4`)

## Video States

### Completed

The full video player is shown with playback controls and the share menu.

### Merging

A spinner with "Merging video segments..." text. The page polls every 2 seconds for status updates.

### Failed

An error message is displayed with the failure reason and a **Retry Merge** button.

### Pending

When no merged video exists yet:

> "No merged video yet. The merged video will be generated automatically once all motion segments are complete."

A **Generate Now** button is available if you want to trigger the merge manually.

## Aspect Ratio Sizing

The theatre player automatically sizes based on your sequence's aspect ratio:

| Ratio | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **16:9** | Full width, standard widescreen |
| **9:16** | Narrow, tall — optimized for mobile preview |
| **1:1** | Square, centered |

All ratios are constrained to `calc(100dvh - 15rem)` maximum height to fit within the viewport alongside the header and navigation tabs.
